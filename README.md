Kish is a one page html template to showcase your developer CV in a professional way.

Designed by Vitali Senevych and Vasyl Kish. You can learn the details of the design process [here](https://www.behance.net/gallery/54409055/Kish-Personal-Site).

## How to customize

### Social media icons

The current social media icons used in the template are Linkedin, Twitch, Github, Skype and Twitter. You swap any of those icons with the social media platform of your choice, which you can find under `/assets/images/icons/social_media_icons`. 

### Profile image

Add your profile image to `/assets/images` and update the `img` with the class `profile-image`.

**Note:** Currently 2 profile images are used—one front facing, and the other right facing—to achieve the look-right effect. If you wish to remove, simply remove `onmouseenter="updateProfileImage()` and `onmouseleave="revertProfileImage()` from `<section class="right"`.
